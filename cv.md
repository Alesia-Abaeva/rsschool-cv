### About me:
---
My career started with the setup and implementation of CRM systems. 
After a couple of months, I realized that it's not enough just to understand the computer well. You need to be able to edit the source code. 

At first, my colleagues helped me, showed me where and what to fix. Then I realized I wanted to know more. But then my training had to be postponed, as I was promoted to Deputy General Director. Having been in this position for more than three years, I entered the department and now I can fully devote myself to studying really interesting things for me. In general, may the force come with me on this difficult path.
